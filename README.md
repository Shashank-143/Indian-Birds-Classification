# Indian Birds Classification Using Deep Learning

## Overview

The **Indian Birds Classification** project aims to develop a deep learning model to accurately classify images of various bird species found in India. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project simplifies the process of bird species identification, contributing to conservation efforts and enhancing ecological studies.

## Objective

- Develop a CNN model to classify images of Indian bird species into predefined categories.
- Deploy the model as a web or mobile application for real-time bird identification.

## Motivation

India's diverse avian population includes many endemic and endangered species. Accurate identification of these species is crucial for conservation, ecological research, and public awareness. This project seeks to automate and streamline the bird identification process using advanced deep learning techniques.

## Scope

- **Dataset**: Images of various Indian bird species.
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.
- **Deployment**: Web or mobile application for real-time classification.

## Dataset

- **Data Source**: Public datasets like the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 (CUB-200), iNaturalist, and manually curated images.
- **Classes**: Includes species such as peacocks, kingfishers, hornbills, Indian rollers, and more.
- **Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and augment images to enhance model performance.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Curate a balanced dataset of Indian bird images.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Resize, normalize, and augment images.
3. **Model Development**: Build and train a CNN model, potentially using transfer learning with pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG.
4. **Training**: Optimize model hyperparameters and train on the dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Deployment**: Create a web or mobile application for real-time bird identification.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- **Deployment Platforms**: Flask (web), TensorFlow Lite (mobile)
